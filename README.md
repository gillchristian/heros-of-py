# Heros of Py

this is a small (_I mean really small_) & silly game I made to learn python syntax. Is not the classical 'Hello World' progra/script/project and it was fun so :)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gillchristina/heros-of-py.git
$ cd heros-of-py
$ python ./main.py
```

you will find it is very short and has A LOT of todo's, so any PRs & issues are welcomed :)

I run it on `python v3.4`, there should not be big issues with `v2.x` but I am not sure.
