#Heros of Py

this is a small & silly game I made to learn python syntax. Is not the classical 'Hello World' progra/script/project and it was fun so :)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gillchristina/heros-of-py.git
$ cd heros-of-py
$ python ./main.py
```

you will find it is very short and has A LOT of todo's, so any PRs & issues are welcomed :)
